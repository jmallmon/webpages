	    <p> I am Joshua Allmon and I am a <strong>first year enginereing major</strong> with a Paper Science Engineering and 
		Chemical Engineering <em>dual degree intent</em>. I chose this major because of the scholarships and internships
		that it offers. I also find the <ins>wide variety of careers</ins> that it offers very appealling. Additionally, PSE
		seems to be a mix of many engineering disciplines which is pretty cool if you ask me.

		In high school, I worked at a golf course as a ranger. I was by far the youngest person who worked this job
		; everyone else was retired. I was in charge of making and arranging tee times, as well as course
		maintenance. I enjoyed the benefits of the job which included free ice cream and free golf.
